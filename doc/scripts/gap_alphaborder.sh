# simple script to toggle dk border opacity based on the gap width
# written by Nathaniel Maia, 2020

# example usage bind with sxhkd
# alt + {equal,minus,apostrophe}
#	 /path/to/script {+5,-5}

# first runs `dkcmd set gap width $1`, then checks to see what the current
# gap setting is if it's >=threshold we add slight border transparency

# does not have to be transparency were toggling, could be any setting where
# multiple states may be desired depending on the situation, but this is just
# an example

# alpha value to use for when borders should be semi-transparent, 00 - ff
# this will get changed to 'ff' when gap width is < threshold
alpha='80'

# gap width threshold for when to turn borders semi-transparent, 1 - N
# 0 would be always setting them semi-transparent, which is wasteful
thresh=10

# border colours, #000000 - #ffffff
